## Hey I'm Divya :)

Thanks for checking out my Github!

Some things about me: 

âœ¨ I am a current Sophomore at the University of Michigan pursuing a dual degree in Computer Engineering and Industrial Operations Engineering. <br/> 

ðŸ”­ The intersection between technology and business excites me, and my strengths include analytical thinking and effective communication. I am actively seeking ways to learn, grow, and tackle complex problems! <br/> 

ðŸ˜„ In my free time I love to cook good food, practice yoga, play poker (in moderation), and travel to cool places! <br/> 

ðŸ“« If you have any questions or want to chat please feel free to email me at divponda@umich.edu, or to connect with me on LinkedIn :)
